#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#A new variable is called to pass the tip_percentage input as an integer
tip_int = int(tip_percentage)
#called_tip is the method to calculate the tip percentage
called_tip = tip_int * .01 + 1

#dividing the flat bill amount by the amount of people splitting the bill
#and lastly multiplying that number by the tip percentage
