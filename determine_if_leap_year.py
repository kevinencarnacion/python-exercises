#Since there is a conditional without an action - to avoid double printing
#the same message

#This is cleaner, instructor provided solution

#I thought of writing it this way, but in terms of my own understanding
#I understood that the system was checking that value
#Writing it out this way just makes it more legible

#I much prefer this second solution, as it is much more legible
#and easier to track all around
#I was on track to get this solution, though worded differently
#but I was determined to make it work with an elif statement
#Moving forward, I will remember the process here and hopefully
#apply it to my work in the future
